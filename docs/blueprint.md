## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#2E9AFE) to reflect trust and professionalism, fitting for a job application dashboard.
- Background color: Light blue (#EBF5FF), a desaturated variant of the primary, creates a calm and uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#BE29EC) to create contrast, especially on interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use 'lucide-react' icons matching the feature semantics.
- Employ a clean, minimalistic layout to focus user attention on the tour and tooltips. Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use smooth fade-in/out animations for tooltips to avoid abrupt transitions. Subtle animations on interactive elements to provide feedback.
